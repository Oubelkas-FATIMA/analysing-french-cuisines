Process flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor until combined, about 3 seconds.\\nDOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS\\nAdd butter and pulse until a coarse meal forms, about 12 pulses. Add egg mixture and pulse until mixture starts to clump together, 10 to 12 pulses. Dough will be crumbly but should hold together when squeezed.\\nDOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS\\nTransfer dough to a clean work surface, and press into a single mass. Divide dough evenly into 2 portions. Pat each half into a 1-inch-thick disk. Tightly wrap each dough disk in plastic wrap.

Let dough sit at room temperature 10 minutes to soften. Lightly grease removable bottom only of a 9 1/2-inch tart pan with butter. Roll dough to a 13-inch circle, dusting dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking. Brush off excess flour from dough.\\nDOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS\\nCarefully roll dough around rolling pin, then unroll over the prepared pan. Press dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan, trimming any excess dough.\\nDOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS\\nAlternatively, press dough into pan without rolling. Patch any cracks with excess dough.\\nDOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS\\nPrick crust all over with a fork.

Don\\'t be! This crêpe recipe yields perfectly delicate, tender results every time.\\nWhat Is a Crêpe?\\nCrêpes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.\\nMEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS\\nHow to Make Crêpes\\nMaking homemade crêpes is easier than you think. You\\'ll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let\\'s go over the basics:\\nWhat Are Crêpes Made Of?\\nCrêpes are easy to make with basic ingredients you likely already have on hand:\\n· Flour: These basic French crêpes start with a cup of all-purpose flour.\\n· Eggs: Eggs act as a binder, which means they help hold the batter together.\\n· Milk: Milk adds moisture and keeps the crêpes tender.\\n· Water: Water helps thin the batter.\\n· Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.\\n· Butter: Butter lends richness and moisture to the crêpes.\\nHow to Make Crêpes At Home\\nHere\\'s a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade crêpes:\\n1. Whisk the flour and eggs.\\n2. Gradually add the milk and water.\\n3. Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle.\\n4. Cook until lightly browned on the bottom.\\n5. Flip and continue cooking until done on both sides.\\nCrêpe Filling Ideas\\nYou can fill and top your crêpes with whatever you like! Popular choices include whipped cream, fresh fruit, fruit sauce, cream cheese, and chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella). You can also make savory crepes with cheese, meats, and veggies.\\nRACKOFLAM\\nHow to Serve Crêpes\\nA fun way to serve crêpes: Set up a crêpe bar where everyone can assemble their own creations with whatever toppings and fillings they want!\\nHow to Store Crêpes\\nStack the crepes with wax paper in between each layer. Place them in an airtight container or zip-top bag, then store in the refrigerator for up to two days. You can freeze the crêpes for up to two months.\\nAllrecipes Community Tips and Praise\\n\"This by far is the best crêpes recipe I tried,\" raves one Allrecipes community member. \"I love crêpes, I am used to the real deal and this is it. I strongly recommend not to make them thick, just remember that you are making crêpes not pancakes.\"\\n\"Such an easy recipe that you can doctor up any way you want,\" according to Sarah \"Wilson\" Arnold. \"I followed the recipe, only added a bit of sugar and vanilla and they are perfect!\"\\n\"Love these and so easy,\" says Kimberly Kays. \"I served them with Greek yogurt, honey, and blueberries.\"\\nEditorial contributions by Corey Williams\\nIngredients\\n1 cup all-purpose flour\\n2 large eggs\\n½ cup milk\\n½ cup water\\n¼ teaspoon salt\\n2 tablespoons butter, melted\\nDirections\\nWhisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.\\nHeat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.\\nCook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more.

There are thousands of amazing crepe recipes out on the Internet. This is not one of them. There’s no sugar in this recipe, so fair warning : these are savory crêpes to people who are looking for a sweet breakfast or desert crêpe? This is not it. Also, the consistency isn’t right. They do not flip easily out of a crate pan and made a mess! As I fed them to my family, they commented what’s with the weird texture?! Our family is very familiar with crepes and this is the least preferred crepe recipe ever. Search further. You’ll find a better recipe.\\nRead More\\nHelpful (0)\\nAllrecipes Member\\n01/29/2023\\nI made two batches of this recipe. A savory one where I added a little chopped dill and chives to the batter. I stuffed those with shredded Swiss and one slice of ham. They were so delicious. My second batter was for my sweet crepes so I added a little confectioner sugar and vanilla extract to the batter. Those I stuffed with Nutella and strawberries. I then topped them with some additional strawberries and blueberries. I added a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkled confectioners sugar. My entire family has now asked that I add this to regular rotation. I cooked them in the tiniest bit of butter brushed on the pan instead of oil. They looked like they were from a magazine.

With this top-rated recipe, you can make restaurant-worthy French onion soup in the comfort of your own kitchen. Plus, get our best ingredient tips and storage secrets.\\nDOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS\\nWhat Is French Onion Soup?\\nFrench onion soup, or soupe à l\\'oignon gratinée, is a classic French dish made with caramelized onions and beef stock or broth. The soup is topped with bread and cheese, then gratinéed to rich, gooey perfection. It\\'s traditionally served in a ramekin or a ceramic crock with a handle.\\n15 Easy and Impressive French Recipes You Can Make at Home\\nWhat Cheese Is Best For French Onion Soup?\\nFrench onion soup is traditionally topped with Gruyère, but other cheeses can be used. Most French onion soups are topped with three cheeses for maximum decadence.\\nThis recipe calls for Parmesan, provolone, and Swiss. Other popular choices include Fontina and mozzarella. No matter which cheeses you choose, make sure not to skimp! French onion soup should be rich and indulgent.\\nWhat Are the Best Onions For French Onion Soup?\\nFrench onion soup is traditionally made with thinly sliced yellow onions. You can also make delicious soup with red or white onions – it just depends on your flavor preferences and what you have on hand.\\nHow to Store French Onion Soup\\nTransfer the cooled soup to an airtight container, but leave out the croutons (they taste best when they\\'re fresh). Store it in the fridge for up to three or four days.\\nHow to Reheat French Onion Soup\\nTo reheat French onion soup, bring it to a boil on the stove. You can add more broiled bread and cheese if you want to go the extra mile, but you can use store-bought croutons for quick and easy results.\\nHow to Freeze French Onion Soup\\nYou can easily freeze French onion soup without the croutons: Just transfer the cooled soup to an airtight, freezer-safe container and freeze up to three months. To make things easier on your future self, you can freeze it in serving-size portions – that way, you don\\'t have to thaw and refreeze the whole batch.\\nTo thaw frozen French onion soup, simply transfer it to the fridge and allow it to defrost overnight. In a rush? You can thaw it more quickly by submerging the sealed container in cool water.\\nAllrecipes Community Tips and Praise\\n\"This was so easy...perfect for after work,\" according to one Allrecipes community member. \"I used Gruyere and Leerdhammer cheeses and they were a great complement.\"\\n\"This soup was awesome,\" raves CANADIANCHICK73. \"I served it at my dinner party.

The only changes/suggestions that I would make are to add a tablespoon of Worchester Sauce and use all butter instead of the olive oil. Make sure that you saute the onions well. (Also, make sure that you slice the onions into fairly wide slices, about 1/2-3/4\" wide.) You don\\'t want them burnt, but you do want them browned. I use Campbell\\'s Double-Rich Beef Consumme and 1/4 cup of Sherry. For the cheese, I put a tablespoon of FRESH shredded Parmesan cheese on the bottom of the bowl, then ladle on the soup, then top with a large homemade crouton, then the swiss cheese, and another tablespoon of the fresh Parmesan. For the croutons, take a large wine-glass and press into a slice of thick bread to get the perfect circle for your soup bowl. Spread with butter and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Put in the oven at 250 for about 1/2 hour or until they are dried and crisp.\\nRead More\\nHelpful (315)\\nMost helpful critical review\\nMARY DOMAZ\\n07/15/2009\\nAs written, I can only give this a three star. It is a basic onion soup recipe that is tasty, but lacks the full-bodied flavor of great onion soup. If you do not carmalize your onions, the soup does not have the sweet flavor of a good onion soup. To carmelize you need to saute at a low heat and be very patient. It typically takes me about an hour to carmelize the 4 cups of onion. Also, cut the fat in this recipe if you are going to try it. No need to fill this recipe with about 150 grams of fat as written. Use just enough fat to keep your onions from burning.\\nRead More\\nHelpful (46)\\nSort By:\\nNewest\\nMarg Delaney\\n02/15/2023\\nsounds yummy-I will be making this for sure\\nHelpful (0)\\nDebbie Jo\\n01/30/2023\\nI cut it down for one serving by using one sliced onion, 1 c beef broth and a splash of sherry.

You can easily make a gourmet restaurant-worthy meal in the comfort of your own kitchen with this top-rated chicken cordon bleu recipe. It\\'s impressive, delicious, and way simpler than you think.\\nALLRECIPES MAGAZINE\\nWhat Is Chicken Cordon Bleu?\\nA cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked.\\nClassic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients: chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices. It\\'s usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard.\\nWhat Does \\'Cordon Bleu\\' Mean?\\n\"Cordon bleu\" translates to \"blue ribbon.\" According to Larousse Gastronomique, a French food encyclopedia, the phrase dates back to medieval times when the most prestigious order a knight could earn was called the Cross of the Holy Spirit. The honor was signified by a medal that hung from a blue ribbon known as Le Cordon Bleu. Over time, the blue ribbon became a symbol of excellence. The term, meanwhile, became associated with food that meets the highest of standards or that is prepared by the most prestigious chefs.\\nHow to Make Chicken Cordon Bleu\\nThere are many ways to make chicken cordon bleu, from the traditional French method to the simple oven-baked one detailed here. You\\'ll find the full recipe below, but here\\'s a brief overview of what you can expect:\\nPrep the Chicken\\nCover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet to create thin, even pieces. Thoroughly season the chicken with salt and pepper.\\nAssemble and Roll\\nTop each piece of chicken with one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of ham. Roll the chicken vertically so that the ham and cheese are contained. Secure each roll with a toothpick.\\nBread and Bake\\nArrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink, top each roll with half a slice of Swiss, and continue baking until the cheese is melted.\\nHow To Make Breadcrumbs\\nHow Long to Cook Chicken Cordon Bleu\\nThis recipe should be fully cooked after 30-35 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. However, every oven is different — the chicken should no longer be pink and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\\nWhat to Serve With Chicken Cordon Bleu\\nChicken cordon bleu is traditionally topped with a decadent cream sauce made with Parmesan cheese and Dijon mustard — you can improvise your own recipe or try spiking our top-rated Alfredo Sauce with a hint of Dijon.\\nLooking for some side dish inspiration? We\\'ve got you covered. Try one of these delicious ideas:\\nMascarpone Mashed Potatoes\\nEasy Garden Green Beans\\nGourmet Mushroom Risotto\\nSteamed Broccoli\\nPommes Anna with Gruyere\\nClassic Restaurant Caesar Salad\\nHow to Store Chicken Cordon Bleu\\nStore your chicken cordon bleu leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for three to four days. Reheat in the oven instead of the microwave to avoid sogginess. About 10 minutes at 350 degrees F should do the trick.\\nHow to Freeze Chicken Cordon Bleu\\nTo freeze chicken cordon bleu, simply arrange the completely-cooled rolls on a lined baking sheet, cover, and freeze for about two hours. Transfer the now-frozen rolls to an airtight freezer bag labeled with the date. Freeze for up to four months.\\nTo thaw frozen chicken cordon bleu, transfer the container to the fridge the night before you plan to serve it. Bake the thawed rolls for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees F.\\nAllrecipes Tips and Community Praise\\n\"What a wonderful recipe,\" raves Pj kearns. \"Simple and delicious! I did use a little olive oil to roll the chicken in after it was constructed and then lightly breaded them. Works out perfectly!\"\\n\"This recipe was the first I have cooked for my family, and they just would not stop complimenting me on it,\" says one Allrecipes community member. \"Not yet being an experienced cook, I didn\\'t add any gimmicks or tricks of my own, and I found that I didn\\'t need to.

My way of cooking for sure. This recipe came out quite close to what I remember her crepes being. I put in some vanilla to jazz it up, and used my biggest pan to twirl on.

They are from the island of Guernsey in the English Channel nut my dads side was French. The only thing different is my mom taught me the crepes had to be thinner than pictured, lacy like doilies. My grandma and mom always made alot of them. They were eaten with my grandmas recipe for French beef stew and doughboys (big round lumpy flour dumplings that were put in the stew. The plumped upon there and also helped thicken the stew.) Then with the remaining that weren’t used for dinner were used for dessert.

Taste is excellent. The first time I made it I found the sauce to be way too thin. I reduced it a lot but still way too thin. The next time I made it, before I added the shallots I added 2tbs flour to the butter and made a rue similar to how you would start bechamel sauce. If you add the following liquids slowly, keep stirring constantly with a whisk so as not to get flour lumps and let the rue take up the liquids slowly you finish up with a much better result.

And, it should have. After all, my mother and I had to make it twice. Let me explain. You MUST BEAT the egg yolks and sugar until they are very pale. For all of you Texas Aggies out there, BTHO the egg yolks. Let the electric mixer run at the highest speed for at least 5 minutes. Because this cake contains no rising agents like baking powder or yeast, its \"fluffy-ness\" depends upon the amount of air that you \"BEAT\" into it - hence the stiff egg whites and the pulverized egg yolks. We decorated the cake with whipping cream and homemade mushrooms (hershey kisses and small marshmallows on toothpicks - with red gel polka dots).\\nRead More\\nHelpful (251)\\nMost helpful critical review\\nHelena\\n12/19/2002\\nLike a chocolate omelete with whipped cream.

This Yule log recipe will quickly become a holiday staple in your household.\\nWhat Is a Yule Log?\\nA Yule log cake, a.k.a. a bûche de Noël, is a traditional holiday dessert that is meant to resemble an actual log. A sponge cake is baked in a Swiss roll pan, filled, rolled into a cylinder, then frosted again.\\nThe yule log tradition goes back centuries: Yule or Yuletide is a winter festival that was historically celebrated by people in Northern Europe. During the festival, a special log burnt on a hearth. Nobody quite knows where this custom comes from, but it\\'s likely the inspiration behind the festive cake.\\nOANA ENNIS/ALLRECIPES\\nHow to Make a Yule Log\\nThis basic Yule log starts with a classic roulade. You\\'ll find the full, step-by step recipe below — but here\\'s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this Yule log:\\n1. Make the filling.\\n2. Make the cake batter and pour it into a prepared pan.\\n3. Bake until the edges start to pull away.\\n4. Turn the cake out on a kitchen towel, roll, and let cool.\\n5. Unroll the cooled cake and spread the filling on top.\\n6. Re-roll it, then sprinkle it with more powdered sugar. Refrigerate until firm.\\nHow to Frost a Yule Log\\nWhen the Yule log is filled and rolled, it\\'s time to frost! To make the ganache frosting, simply whisk the chocolate chips and hot cream until smooth. Cut the ends off the log, then spread a layer of ganache all over the cake. Use a fork or knife to make ridges in the frosting. Continue until the log resembles tree bark.\\nYule Log Decorations\\nYou can keep your Yule log simple or take it up a notch with whimsical decorations (check out our top-rated fondant recipe to make your own edible decor). Here are some gorgeous ideas from talented members of the Allrecipes community:\\nMAGGIEJ\\nYAN\\nCHEF JOHN\\nHow to Store a Yule Log\\nCover the frosted Yule log loosely in storage wrap and store it in the fridge for up to three days or freeze it for up to three months (thaw in the fridge overnight).\\nAllrecipes Community Tips and Praise\\n\"I made a Yule log for the first time last Christmas using this recipe, and it turned out so fantastic,\" raves Nicki Bortz. \"It will definitely be a Christmas tradition. The chocolate filling and coffee liquor are what originally sold me, and it did not disappoint!\"\\n\"Made this for Christmas and my husband loved it so much he wants this for his birthday,\" says Lynette. \"The buttercream and ganache were perfect. Not too sweet. The addition of the mascarpone and Kahlua puts it over the top!\"\\n\"The amount of filling was perfect for me,\" according to Linda. \"I was pleasantly surprised that it did not stick like many others I\\'ve made. I did a display without mushrooms using cranberries greenery. On the outside of my plate I put little twigs.\"\\nEditorial contributions by Corey Williams\\nIngredients\\nButtercream Filling:\\n1 ⅔ cups powdered sugar\\n½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature\\n2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur\\n1 ½ tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder\\n1 pinch salt\\n⅓ cup mascarpone cheese\\nSponge Cake:\\n2 tablespoons melted butter\\n½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder\\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\\n½ teaspoon kosher salt\\n5 large eggs, at room temperature\\n⅔ cup white sugar\\n½ teaspoon vanilla\\n2 tablespoons powdered sugar, or as needed\\nGanache Frosting:\\n1 cup heavy cream, boiling-hot\\n1 (8 ounce) package dark chocolate chips\\nDirections\\nMake the buttercream filling: Whip powdered sugar, butter, coffee-flavored liqueur, cocoa powder, salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed.\\nTransfer filling mixture to a separate bowl and add mascarpone cheese. Mix until combined; set aside. Clean and dry the stand mixer bowl.\\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\\nPrepare a 13x18-inch rimmed sheet pan for the sponge cake: Brush a little melted butter over the sheet pan, then line the pan with parchment paper, and brush remaining melted butter on top.\\nWhisk cocoa powder, flour, and salt together in a bowl, making sure to break up any clumps.\\nPlace eggs in the clean bowl of your stand mixer. Add sugar and whip with the whisk attachment until fluffy, thick, and very light in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add vanilla and 1/2 of the cocoa powder mixture; mix on low speed for a few seconds. Add the remaining cocoa mixture and mix on low for a few seconds. Switch to high speed and mix until the mixture is moistened but not fully blended. Pull off the whisk attachment and use it to whisk the batter by hand until evenly blended.\\nPour batter onto the prepared sheet pan and spread out with a spatula, almost to the edges, but not quite. Tap the pan on the counter several times to remove any large air bubbles.\\nBake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges start to pull away from the sides, 8 to 10 minutes.\\nWhile the cake is baking, sift powdered sugar onto a clean kitchen towel to cover an area slightly larger than the sponge cake.\\nRemove cake from the oven. Run a knife around the edges of the pan. Dust some powdered sugar over the top. Run a spatula under the parchment paper to make sure it\\'s not stuck to the pan.\\nQuickly flip the pan on top of the sugared area on the towel to invert the cake. Carefully remove the parchment paper, then sift more powdered sugar over the cake. Gently roll the cake up inside the towel; allow to cool for 15 minutes.\\nCarefully unroll the cooled cake. Dollop as much buttercream filling as you like on top, reserving some for later; spread to the edges. Roll cake up over the filling, using the towel to lift it if needed. Sprinkle more powdered sugar on top over the log, then wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.\\nMake the ganache frosting: Pour hot cream over chocolate chips in a bowl. Let sit for 1 minute, then whisk until chocolate is melted.\\nMake an angled cut 3 inches from one end of the log. Place log on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Apply some filling to the angled slice and attach it to one side of the log. Spread a layer of ganache all over the cake, except for the swirls on the ends. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to firm up the ganache.\\nUse the tip of a knife to carve lines into the ganache to create the appearance of tree bark. Refrigerate until completely chilled.\\nDust with cocoa powder and powdered sugar before serving.\\nCHEF JOHN\\nChef\\'s Notes:\\nI used all of the buttercream filling and thought it was a bit too much. In the future, I\\'d probably use 2/3 of the filling for this recipe, and save the rest for cupcakes.\\nIf you have a favorite frosting or filling, it will work here. As long as you can slice it later, pretty much anything goes. You can also add a splash of milk to achieve a lighter, fluffier buttercream.\\nYou can also drizzle the baked sponge with many delicious, possibly adult beverages, such as dark rum, kirsch, or raspberry liqueur, just to name a few.\\nI MADE IT\\nPRINT\\nNutrition Facts (per serving)\\n526 Calories\\n34g Fat\\n56g Carbs\\n6g Protein\\nShow Full Nutrition Label\\nReviews (101)\\nCheck out our Community Guidelines about reviews.\\nWhat do you think of this recipe?

It was really helpful to have the video resource while I was preparing the log. Highly recommend. My only hiccup was the ganache. It was a bit too liquidy after setting on the countertop all night. Added more chocolate but then ended up too thick. Still used it but making the \"bark\" with the knife was hard. I have never made ganache so I chalked that up to being a beginner. Using plenty of powered sugar is definitely a good idea. The only changes I made were 1) using frangelica instead of kahlua, which was delicious, and 2) using espresso mascarpone bc that\\'s what the grocery store had. It is mild flavored so no problem. Used mistletoe to decorate but might try meringue mushrooms next time. It\\'s a little time consuming but if you want to up your baking skills, I would recommend this recipe.\\nRead More\\nHelpful (0)\\nchristy1010\\n12/26/2022\\nThe frosting was delicious but there was barely enough to cover the cake with only a very thin layer. I don\\'t even understand how the chef\\'s note says it was too much frosting and that they would only use 2/3 of it. Needs at least 1.5 X\\'s if not double. My cake also turned out a tiny bit dry and cracked in a few places after the frosting was on and I had to roll it back up. Not sure what I did wrong there. I did watch the video and set an alarm for exactly 15 minutes to unroll, frost, and roll it back up. Despite these couple of small problems, the end result turned out very tasty and beautiful. I appreciated the video, it was extremely helpful. You have to let the ganache cool quite a bit before using if you don\\'t want it to drip. Once it\\'s chilled a bit and thicker it\\'s perfect for spreading. I was able to work with it after about 20-30 minutes in the fridge.\\nRead More\\nHelpful (0)\\nAllrecipes Member\\n12/26/2022\\nThis recipe was the worst!
